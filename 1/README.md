## Assignment 01: Set up and prerequisites

1. Git
- Install git.
https://git-scm.com/downloads

- You may see references to the stand alone app for git on your desktop. That's not what we're using for this course.

- Watch the videos in this series that you need to watch (seriously, even if you've been working with git for a while, it's sometimes handy to revisit, e.g., the difference between git and Github). They are on youtube. If you don't have a subscription, it will pop up with short ads. Sorry, but these are really decent videos. There's about 30 min total.

- Follow the instructions to do what the videos walk you through. 



2. Data Engineering Jobs

- Google "data engineering jobs"
- Read ads (between 5&10)
- What are companies looking for in skills, experience, competencies?
  * Answer:
    All companies are looking for a solid background in computer science with derelevant degrees to back it up.  Java and Python seem to be the two most popular languages.  Experience working with cloud and UNIX environments like is helpful.  For any position dealing with "big data", knowledge of Hadoop and the HDFS is mandatory.  Otherwise, basic SQL competency is also required.  Knowledge of machine learning seems to be a plus for data engineers, but it is not a mandatory requirement for many companies.

    Companies also ask for generic non-technical skills such as good communication and ability to work on teams.
